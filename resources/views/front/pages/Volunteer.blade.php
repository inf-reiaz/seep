								<h3> <a href="">Policy on Volunteering At SEEP- Local & Overseas</a> </h3>
								<p>
									<h4>Introduction</h4>
									1.1	This policy sets out the broad principles for voluntary involvement in SEEP. It is of relevance to staff, beneficiaries, and governing body of the organisation. 
									
									<p>
										1.2	This policy was endorsed by Executive Committee, SEEP on March 27,2012 and was subsequently approved by Governing body and will be kept under review to ensure that it remains appropriate to the needs of SEEP and its volunteers.
	 								</p>
								</p>
								<p>
									<h4>Commitment</h4>
										2.1	Volunteers are an established and integral part of the work of SEEP. Inviting people from the community into our organisation ensures that we have the community’s support and input into our activities. Volunteering provides benefits which are above and beyond those supplied by statutory services, and which improve the quality of peoples’ lives. Without the involvement of volunteers in this organisation we would not be able to provide the range of services and activities.
									
									<p>
										2.2	SEEP is committed to working with volunteers to meet its purpose and objectives. Volunteering involvement in appropriate tasks is welcome, encouraged, developing at all levels of the organisation’s activity.
